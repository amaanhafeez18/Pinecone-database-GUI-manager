PLEASE INSERT THIS INTO THE ENV FOR THE BACKEND. 

DEPT_NAMES={"ALL DEPT":"1234","HR":"0000","IT":"0909","COMPLIANCE":"8989","Meow":"9090"}

The way the system is set up, the drop down menu in the frontend pulls the names of the departments from the backend, and the user must enter 
the appropriate password for their department and click "login and load files". The user is not able to upload a file unless they login first. 


Uploading: to upload, login with the relevant department credentials, select a file, wait for it to upload. refresh list of files. The file is now associated with that department. 


Known bug:
When logged in with ALL-DEPT, all files are visible for the organization, however editing and saving those files sets their category as ALL-DEPT instead of the orignal one
